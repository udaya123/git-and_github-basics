# Git and GitHub Basics
>*To begin you will want to fork a copy of this repository and pull it down to your local machine.*

#### Installing Git
> Assuming you have brew installed. Use the following terminal command to install `$ brew install git`.

#### Setting up Git with GitHub
> If you have not already setup a GitHub account, do so now. Please make sure to keep your GitHub account name professional. We recommend that you turn on two-factor authentication as well.

> Follow [GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) for setting up Git with your GitHub account. Make sure to setup your [connection over SSH](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/). Trust us you will want to avoid having to type your password over and over again. Plus, it is much more secure.

#### Put Your Knowledge to Practice
> Now that you understand the basics;

>1. Pull down your forked copy of this repository.
2. Update this markdown file to replace the following image with an image of your choosing. I hear [Giphy](http://giphy.com/) has some pretty great stuff.
3. Take a moment to blog below why version control is important to you. Put your own spin on your explanation.
4. Commit your changes with a brief and meaningful message.
5. Push up the changes to **your forked version of the repository**.
